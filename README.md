Scrape-It Crypto News Scraper
is an app built using node, express, cheerio, axios, and javascript, using a mongodb database and deployed to heroku.

The site will scrape all current news stories from the front page of www.coindesk.com

Future plans are:
- To have buttons such as "mark as read" to delete entries
- To only update the db with unique entries, as not to clutter db
- To be able to add user specific notes to each headline entry
- To save favorite articles to user profile for later reading
